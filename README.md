# AugmentedReading

# Inspiration
As amateur readers, we want to inspire other people to read more. We would also would like to provide a unique experience to each user, based on his or her reading preferences.

# What it does
We setup an augmented reading experience, where a reader can dive into the story using context-adapted acoustic and visual effects.

# How we built it
We built it using Logitech's state of the art technology : a high definition webcam, a high-speed internet router, a cutting edge audio speaker (seriously waterproof) and a 16 million colors RGB lights. Of course, we also had to add a dash of good will, a spoon of lack of sleep and a tad of motivation to get this far.

# What we learned
openCV, logitech frameworks, pygame, not giving up

# What's next for Augmented Reading
An even better reader experience, adding more sounds, emotions and context understanding.

# Music
thanks to https://www.bensound.com and others for their free sounds
